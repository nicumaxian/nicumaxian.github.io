      <description>These days I needed a realisation of string ASCII validator. After few google attempts, I found a single constant unicode.MaxASCII in Go SDK, which could help to resolve this problem. To be sure, I asked on stackoverflow.
Since we were discussing about performance, user peterSO did a benchmark, which had a really interesting numbers. I decided to go forward and create more implementations. Source code can be found here.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back again to my Algorithms and Data Structure journey. This time I will write a post for each chapter or topic.
Min/Max Heap definition A Max Heap is a binary tree where it&amp;rsquo;s respected exactly one condition
 Every node should be greater than it&amp;rsquo;s childs
 And the same rule is applied for Min Heap
 Every node should be smaller than it&amp;rsquo;s childs
 Data structure As a data structure, heap is a nearly complete binary tree.</description>
